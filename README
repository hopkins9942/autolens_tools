autolens_tools: Analysis tools and example scripts for PyAutoLens

NFW_sersic_simulator.py simulates images of lens systems with realistic lens galaxies composed of an NFW profile to represent the dark matter mass distribution and a sersic profile to represent the stellar matter mass distribution.

NFW_sersic_exp_simulator.py simulates images of lens systems with realistic lens galaxies composed of an NFW profile to represent the dark matter mass distribution and both a sersic profile and an exponential profile to represent the stellar matter mass distribution.

power_law_fitter.py fits images of lensing systems modelling the lens with a power law mass distribution using two linked phases, the first of which has the slope of the power law profile set to 2 (isothermal) and other simplifying assumtions that speed up the fitting process.

Analyser.ipynb is a tool for easy analysis of completed phases using the aggregator, which compares the values of the parameters and the radial mass distributions of the true and fitted galaxies.

ExampleData contains some data generated from the simulator scripts and fitted with power_law_fitter.py that can be loaded directly into the Analyser.ipynb tool as a demonstration.
